## What is this repository?
This is where I'll post the majority of exercises/material I'll be given throughout my years at University of Parma.
I'll be posting my own solutions as well, for academic purposes. I'm planning to add notes (possibly in Latex, once i master it)

## Why should you use it?
Say you're a new student and you'd like to know what we actually do during the courses, here you'll find what you're looking for.
You might also find examples on top of my own takes on programming exercises.

## Basic etiquette
Any contribution is well accepted, if you need help, feel free to hit me up. What I absolutely don't tolerate is stealers and cheaters. This repo is means to facilitate your journey here, which doesn't mean stealing someone else work. Peace <3

## Material added so far
1. C++ Exercises (solutions are attached, 100/100 score on each of them)
